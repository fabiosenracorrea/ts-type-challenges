# Typescript Type Challenges

This repo captures the TS challenges from [type-challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges)

Last synced: 2025-02-28

> These challenges were done with no cheating of the solution. Some of them contain extra types that could be derived from the main type idea or multiple solutions that either consider multiple use-cases or all solve it

> The difficulty level comes from the repo itself. Some of the ratings are quite questionable. Example, "Includes" and "Push" both marked as easy does not make that much sense. Anyway..

### How to validate

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn` or `pnpm install`
3. Access the challenge to verify no errors are present

Later will add a "run all completed" script to facilitate that work, but the ideia here is to individually look at the approaches, instead of blindly seeing that it simply pass all
